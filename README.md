# MUD <> Fluent

## 🚧 Requirements

### 🪂 Detailed instructions: [SETUP.md](https://github.com/ArchetypalTech/mud-pie/blob/main/SETUP.md)

| Package  | Version  |
| -------- | -------- |
| `node`   | 20.11.90 |
| `pnpm`   | 9.15.5   |
| `docker` | 27.3.1   |

## 📦 Initial Repo Setup

1. Install the dependencies listed above in Requirements, verify correct version.
2. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ArchetypalTech/mud-pie.git
```

3. Go to cloned directory

```bash
cd mud-pie
```

4. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

## 🏠 Local Deployment

Make sure Docker deamon is running.

Navigate to the `mud-pie/fluent/` dir

```bash
cd fluent
```

Then run:

```bash
pnpm mud:dev:local
```

⚠️ If `contracts` is `DOWN`, navigate to contracts and press the `r` key to reset the process and wait for all transactions to finish before using the counter button.

#### Intel mac:

```bash
pnpm mud:dev:local:intel
```

Point your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the running client.

## 🏥 Troubleshooting

### 🚾 Stopping local containers

After running the scripts you will have to manually close the docker.

Stop the containers with:

```sh
docker stop $(docker ps -q --filter ancestor=ghcr.io/fluentlabs-xyz/fluent:latest)
```

or using `pnpm`

```sh
    pnpm mud:dev:stop
```

see `./fluent/DEV-NOTES.md` for some troubleshooting tips.

### 🧹Cleanup

To clean up the local nodes state

```sh
rm -rf fluent/.local-node
```

### 🐛 Intel Mac

On an Intel Mac `mprocs` must be installed seperately:

```bash
brew install mprocs
```

## 🔍 Expected Results

The commands open a `mprocs` terminal with the running processes.

Use the up and down arrows to see the output from each process and `Ctrl-U`/`Ctrl-D` to scroll through the respective outputs

Your increment counter clicks show up as transactions on the block explorer.

Your MUD fluent deploy is working! Congrats.

# 🔧 Available Scripts

the follwowing scripts are avilable via pnpm from the `fluent` directory:

| Script                  | Description                                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mud:dev:local`         | runs a local Fluent node, builds contracts, deploys for node, runs local web server                  |
| `mud:dev:testnet`       | builds contracts, deploys for testnet, runs local web server                                         |
| `mud:dev:stop`          | stops the running local fluent node container                                                        |
| `mud:dev:local:intel`   | (for intel macs) runs a local Fluent node, builds contracts, deploys for node, runs local web server |
| `mud:dev:testnet:intel` | (for intel macs) builds contracts, deploys for testnet, runs local web server                        |

## 🚀 Testnet Deployment

Deployment to Testnet requires setting the correct keys in `.env` [packages/contracts/.env](https://github.com/ArchetypalTech/mud-pie/blob/main/packages/contracts/.env) and [packages/client/.env](https://github.com/ArchetypalTech/mud-pie/blob/main/packages/client/.env).

You will also need to change the `VITE_CHAIN_ID` var in `packages/client/.env` [packages/client/.env](https://github.com/ArchetypalTech/mud-pie/blob/main/packages/client/.env) to reflect the chain id for the chain (1337 for local and 20993 for the fluent testnet)

Navigate to the `mud-pie/fluent/` dir, then run:

```bash
pnpm mud:dev:testnet
```

#### Intel mac:

```bash
mud:dev:testnet:intel
```

Point your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the running client.

## 🧪 Running Tests

Navigate to the `mud-pie/fluent/` dir, then execute:

```bash
pnpm mud:test
```
