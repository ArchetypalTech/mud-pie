# Trouble shooting

Please do ensure you are using the correct dependencies, they are listed in the root README.md. Things will not work other wise.

Please bear in mind this is not tested over every linux distribution and we have seen false positives, this does not mean that the project is not working.

When running locally you'll probably want to stop the local node and delete its state if you change the contracts a fair amount. just `rm -rf fluent/.local-node`

the .env files are in the repo. you'll want to remove them and NOT commit any private keys in any kind of non testing environment. this is a demo project. Don't forget!

## If you have dependency issues

If dependency errors occur, clean packages and clear Docker.

### Clean packages and node_modules

There are 4 package.json files

The one in the root of the project and:
`/package.json`
`fluent/package.json`
`packages/client/package.json`
`packages/contracts/package.json`

this means that pnpm will create a node_modules folder in each of these paths 

`/node_modules`
`fluent/node_modules`
`packages/client/node_modules`
`packages/contracts/node_modules`

If you want to reset the dependency tree you need to remove all of these folders

You will possibly also have a corresponding pnpm-lock.yaml file in these places:

`/pnpm-lock.yaml`
`fluent/pnpm-lock.yaml`
`packages/client/pnpm-lock.yaml`
`packages/contracts/pnpm-lock.yaml`

Remove these as well.

### to re install the dependencies:

From the root run `pnpm install`

This should reinstall everything the project needs.

### Clear containers

Sometimes dcoker containers can cause conflicts. To see if there is a image hanging or what have you you can use:

`docker ps`

kill anything running

`docker stop whatever_the_name_is`

the local node also keeps its own files (which is handy)

you may want to clean that up as well

`/fluent/.local_node`

so then:

stop the container (if itâ€™s running)

remove `/fluent/.local_node`
